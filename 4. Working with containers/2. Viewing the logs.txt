we have 2x Containers running in the background
	Problem
		we don't know what is going on iside these containers
			what if something goes wrong? what if the server generates and error?
				
Log command				
docker ps
	docker logs b96
	
	we see the output of this server
		that is exactly the same, when we start our container in foreground
		
	docker logs --help
	
	
		docker logs -f 123		#real time output
		
		docker logs -n 5 123		#show the last 5 lines
		
		docker logs -n 5 -t 655		#date + time
