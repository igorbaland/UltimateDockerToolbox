When we are the container, it executes the default command  that we specified in our dockerfile

What if we want to execute the command in a running container later.

#execute command in running container
docker exec c1 ls
	#see the content of  direcctory app
	# because we specifyied in dockerfile
		WORKDIR /app
		
		
docker exec -it c1 sh
	exit
