Each ccontainer has its own file system that is invisible to other containers

docker ps
	2 conainers are running
	
	start shell session on the first container
		write something to a file  in the application directory
		
		docker exec -it 423 sh
		echo data > data.txt
		exit
		
	start a new shell session on the second container
		docker exec -it 9c2 sh
		ls | grep data
	
			#data is not there 
				because each container has it's own file system, that is invisible to other containers
				
			That means, if we delete this container , it's file system also go with them 
			and we will lose our data
We should never store our data in a containers file system
