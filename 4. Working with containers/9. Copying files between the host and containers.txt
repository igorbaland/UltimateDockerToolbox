Sometimes we need to copy files between the host and a container
	For example, logfile, we want to bring it to the host and analyze it.
	
Create a log file in app dir
	docker exec -it 524 sh
	echo hello > log.txt
	exit
	
#copy command
	docker cp containerId:pathToTheFile	.			#source destination
	
#create file in our workdir and copy it to the container
	echo hello > secret.txt
	
	docker cp secret.txt containerId:/app
	
	docker exec -it containerId sh
		docker ls
