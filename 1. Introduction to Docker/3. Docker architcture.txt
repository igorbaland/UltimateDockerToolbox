Client	---REST API--->	Server

Technically, container is just a process. Unlike virtual machines,
	containers don't contain a full blown OS. Instead all containers on a host shre the
		OS of the host
		More accurately, all these containers share the kernel of the host.

		Kernel is the core of an OS. It's like an engine of the car. Is the part that manages all applications
			memory and cpu

Every OS has its own kernel or engine. And this kernels have different APIs

Machines
	Linux only run linux linux container

	Windows we can run both
		Windows + linux, because windows 10 is now shipped with a custom built Linux kernel
			Windows shares a windows container
			Linux shares a linux container
				(not the same)

	Mac OS
		has own kernel, which is different from linux and windows kernel
			use Linux VM
