mkdir hello-docker

cd hello-docker

code .		#VSCode

#create js file
console.log("Hello docker") 

#without docker
	start with an OS
	we need to install node
	copy app files
	and than run 
		node app.js

Add dockerfile, capital D without any extension
Dockerfile		#VSCode, install recommended extensions...

#hub.docker.com, search linux, node...
FROM node:alpine	
COPY . /app	
WORKDIR	/app		#without WORKDIR /app, CMD node /app/app.js
CMD node app.js

#terminal
docker build -t	hello-docker .		#-t tag

#image isn't stored in our workdir, how docker storage this image is very complex

docker images			#or image ls

#now we can run this image on any computer running docker
docker run hello-docker		#it doen't matter which directory we are in

#play with docker (googln)
add new instance
#terminal
docker pull ... 		#docker download this image
docker image ls
docker run ...
