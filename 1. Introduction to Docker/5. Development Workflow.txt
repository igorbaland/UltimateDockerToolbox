Application
...
...				Dockerfile	->	Image
...


Image
	contains everything, that we need to run
		
		a cut-down OS
		a runtime environment (eg Node)
		application files
		third-party libraries
		environment variables
		...


After we have an image, we tell docker to start a container using that image

Container is just a process. It has own file system, which is provided by the image

docker run...


The beauty of docker, 
	once we have this image, we can push it to a docker registry, like DockerHub
		DockerHub is like GitHub
