				every linx user has 
					1x primary group
					0..n secondary
				Why are the groups separated?
					Let's say, john is part of 5x groups
						and we want to create a newFile
						
						Every file is own by 1 user and 1 group
						
						If john is a part of 5 groups, to which group 
						the new file will be added?
							That is why we need a primary group
							
		usermod -G developers john 
			1. cat /etc/passwd | grep -i john
			2. grep john /etc/passwd
			
			//list groups with user john
			groups john
				john : john developers
