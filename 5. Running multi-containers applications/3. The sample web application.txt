We are going to look at a real world application with 
	multiple blocks
		frontend
		backend
		database
		
steps without docker
	node project
		1. download project
		2. installing all dependencies
		3. start the webserver
	
	frontend project
		#the same steps as a node project
		
			
	mongoDB
		the same steps
	
		we need 3 x sessions/terminal windows to running 
			backend 
			frontend 
			mongoDB
			...
			
We have so many steps that we have to follow at the moment we check out the source code from our GitHub repo


--------
With a docker we don't have to do any ot these things
	all we have to do 
		is run a single command
		
cmd > root of this project
	dir
		...
		docker-compose.yml
			which is used for composing a multi container application. Once we have this file in our project
				we can simply run 
				
				docker-compose up
					
					1. docker will automatically downloading 
						mongoDB 
					at the same time it's goint to install all these dependenies for our
						frontend
						backend
							project
					2. start webserver
						and run automated tests all in this window
							and we can access it in client
							
							
The beauty is that our database is populated with these movies as part of bringing up our application
	We didn't have to manually insert these movies in our database. 
		We have a migration script for populating our database and
			Docker automatically executed our migration script as part of bringing up this application
				This is very common real world scenario
				
We brought up this application 
	using a single command
	
	
docker-compose.yml
	yml format
