docker-compose up		#starting app
	if the images are ready, docker start container
		if not, docker will automatically build and than start
		
--build		#force to rebuild everytime when we run an app

docker-compose up --build		#combine

-d		#detach mode, start a container in the background

docker-compose ps
	#we can see all the containers relevant to this application
	
	#in contrast
	docker ps 		#we can see all the running container across all applications
	
	vidly_api_1
	vidly_db_1
	vidly_web_1
		why does it 1?
			we can start multiple containers from the same image and this is useful for 
				high availability and scalability
				
#show commands
	npm start
	mongod
	npm start
	
#ports mapping
	


#stop container
docker-compose down		#this wil stop and remove these containers
						but the images are still there
