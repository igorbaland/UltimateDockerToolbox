Running automated tests

For both these projects (frontend and backend)
	we have ready test scripts
	
	1 way to run this test
	#go to  backend directory	
	npm test
	
#run tests inside a container, but it is very slow, because the tests going be always exucute, after we change something
	the benefits, de don't must to run tests for backend and frontend
	
	
	docker-compose.yml
		#we want to use the existing image, the image that was built for this service
		#duplicate our backend/api service
