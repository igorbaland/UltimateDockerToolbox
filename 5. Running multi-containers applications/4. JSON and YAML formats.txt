Why don't we use yaml all the time?
Because parsing yaml files is a little bit slower than parsing JSON file.
	Becaue the parser doen't know 
		if this is a string or a number 
		
In contrast in json, 
	strings are represented using quotes and more specifically, double quotes
	
	
YAML
	for configuration files
JSON
	for exchanging data beteen mulltiple computers like a client and a server
