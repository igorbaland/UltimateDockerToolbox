Docker compose is built on top of docker engine. Everything we have done with docker engine,
	like building images, listening them, starting container and so on
		All of these operations are also available using Docker docker compose
		
docker-compose	#help

The difference is that every of this commands will apply to our application as whole
	Most of this commands will impact multiple services or 
		multiple containers in our application 
		
	docker-compose build --help
	
		--no-cache 		#we can prevent caching when building the image. Sometimes we encoutner weird issues 
						and e want to make sure that cache is not used.
						
		--pull			#with this we can always pull a newer version of the image
		
	docker-compose build
		#note, in our working dir, not in docker-compose file directory
		
		# our build war super fast, because everything came from the 
			cache
		
		docker images
			we build only 2 at the top images frontend and backen
				the 2 other we built earlier
				
				appName_frontend
				
				appName is the name of the dir
				
				
				created column
				
	docker-compose build --no-cache			#full rebuild
