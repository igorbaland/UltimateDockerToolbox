we are going to map our project directory, like the backend directory to 
	the app dirctory inside our container
	
Exactly like before, changes is immedatily visible inside a container

We have to do this seperately
	backend
	frontend
	
open docker-compose file
	services:
		api:
		...
		environment:
		volumes:		#we can have 1 or more volumes mapping, here we need add array syntax
			- ./backend:/app
		
		docker-compose up
			error
				sh: nodemon: not found		#nodemount is package,that our backend project dependent on it
				
				backend
					package.json
					
				backend run
					npm install

docker-compose up
