frontend react app
	package.json
		//the third-party librariesÂ´, our application needs to run
		"dependencies": {
			
		}
		
let's say we want take this application and run it on a brand new machine.
	we don't have anything,
		but an operating system
		
		There are number of steps
			we have to follow
		
			1. install node
				once we have node, we can use 
					package manager or npm to install the dependencies of this application
						when we run this command
							npm is going to look at 
								package.json
									that is going to automatically
										download and store all these third-party libraries in this project
			2. npm install
				node_modules
					//all dependencies
			3. npm start
			
		We have the same concept in other development stacks
