Dockerfile
	FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13
	COPY package.json /app		#if dir app doen't exist,
								docker will automatically created it
											
	#we can also copy more file
	COPY package.json README.md /app/	#note /app + /
	
	#we can also use patterns
	package*.json
	
	#everything in current directory into the app dir
	COPY . /app/
	
	#destination
		#relativ path if we set the working dir first
		WORKDIR /app
		COPY . .		#. using the period, meaning the current directory
		
	#copy the file that has a space in it
	WORKDIR /app
	COPY ["hello world.txt", "."]		#syntax error
		#copy has a lot of form where we can pass an array of strings 
		["", "", ""]



ADD	
	has the exact same syntax as copy, but add hast 2x additional features
		1. add a file from url
			ADD http://.../file.json .
		2. if pass the compressed file
			add will automatically uncompressed this into a a directory
			
			FROM
			WORKDIR /app
			COPY . .
			ADD file.zip .
	
		
		
#with this we can copy one or more  files or directories
	from the current directory,
		meaning our project react-app into image react-app 
		we cannot copy anything outside of this directory
			here is the reason, when we are executed build command
				docker -t react-app .
	#. means, the current directory
	docker client sends the content this directory to Docker engine
		This is called 
			The build context
			So at that point,
				Docker engine does not have access to any files or directories
				out this directory
