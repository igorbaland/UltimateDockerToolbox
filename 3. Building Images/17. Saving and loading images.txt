Let's say, we have an image on this machine, and we want to put it on another machine,
	but without dockerhub
	
	
	In this case we can save that image as a compressed file and load it on the other machine.
	
docker image save --help

docker image save -o react-app.tar react-app:3 		#tar on linux, zip on windows, compressed file
#current working dir

Each layer contains 
	json
	layer.tar		contains all the files in that layer
	

#load command
docker image load --help


docker image load -i react-app.tar
docker images
