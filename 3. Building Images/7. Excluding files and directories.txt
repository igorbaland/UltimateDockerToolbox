Docker client takes everything in our directory
	that is called 
		the build context or the context directory
			and send it to
				docker engine or docker daemon
				
2 benefits of excluding third-party libraries
	1. Our build context is smaller
		We transfer less data over the network
	2. Our build is gonna be faster
		We don't have to wait of all these files 
			to be transferred to docker engine

Excluding, like .gitignore
	
	.dockerignore		#everything in lowercase
	
	node_modules/		
	
We reduce transferring context from
	100+ mB to 4+ kB
