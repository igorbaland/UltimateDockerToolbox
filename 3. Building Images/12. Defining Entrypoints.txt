-it, interract with with this container, we are not going to run a shell session

docker run react-app
	#our container started and than stopped, becaus we are din't specify a command or a program to execute
	
	docker eun react-app npm start
	#Error access
	EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/node_modules/.cache'
	
		Dockerfile
		USER app
		
		#we should move addgroup/adduser and user on the top
		FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13
		RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
		USER app
		WORKDIR /app
		COPY . .
		RUN npm install
		ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com/
		EXPOSE 3000
		
			*****save dockerfile*****
		
		docker build
		run
		
			our werbserver is started on port 3000. This port 3000 is a port of container, not localhost
			If we go to this address we are not going be able to access the application.
			
#we don't want to specify this command with docker run
docker run react-app npm start
	#to solve this we are using command instruction
		CMD npm start
		
		
		FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13

		rebuild image
		start container without npm start
		
		#note
		because the command instruction is for supplying the default command
			it doesn't make sense to have multiple command instructions in a Dockerfile
				If we have multiple command instructions,
					only the last will take effect.*********
					
					
#diff RUN and CMD
	with both these we can execute commands

		
		RUN
			is a build time instruction
				this is executing of the time of building the image
		
		1. #shell form
		CMD
			Command instruction
				is the runtime instruction
					will executed, when starting a container
					
		2. #execute form
		CMD["npm", "start"]
		
			#diff between shell and execute forms
				if we use the shell form
					docker will execute this command inside the separate shell
					#linux > bin/sh
					#windows > cmd
				
				execute form
					the common best practice is to use execute form,
						because with this we can execute this command directly
							there is no need to spin up another sharp process.
					Also this makes easier and faster to clean up resources, when we stop containers
					
ENTRYPOINT
	has two forms
		1. shell
		
		2. execute
			ETRYPOINT ["npm", "start"]
			
		diff between ENTRYPOINT and CMD
			entrypoint override command
			Example:
				docker run ... echo hello
				entrypoint -> echo
			
				
			by cmd we cannot easily override command
				if we want to override, we have to use 
					--entrypoint opttion
					
					docker run react-app --entrypoint
