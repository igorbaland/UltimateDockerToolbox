npm start
	this starts at development server on port 3000
	
	When we run this application inside a docker container,
		this port will be open on the container, not on the host
		
On the same machine we ca have multiple containers running the same image
	All these containers will be listening to port 3000,
		but the port 3000 on the host is not going be automatically mapped to these containers.

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

	#expose command doesn't  automatically publish the port on host. 
	It just a form of documentation to tell us this container will eventually listen on port 3000.
