Image
	includes everything an application needs to run
	
		cut-down OS
		third-party libraries
		application files 
		environment variables...
		
		an image conains all the files and configuration settings
		needed to run an application
		
Once we have an image, we can start all
	Container from it. Container is kind of like a virtual machine
		
		provides an isolated environment
			for executing an application
		can be stopped & restarted containers,
			similar to virtuel machines
		just a process
			it is special kind of process, because it has its own file system
				wich is provided by an image
				
docker ps	#show the running processes or containers
#we want to start  new container from the same image
#run container
docker run -it imageName		#-it, interactive mode -> we can work with it
we have 2 containers with same image and different container'sId

#back to our first container
	ls		#currently in home dir
		bob	deploy.show	john	mosh
		
#back to our second session (second container)
cd /home
	ls
	
	#nothing here. Here is the reason
		A container get its file system from the 
			image
			But each container has it own 
				right layer						!!!!!!!!
					What we write in a given container is
						invisible from other containers
						
						Of course, the are the way to share data between containers
						
Each container is a an isolated environment for executing an application. 
	It's an isolated universe

[CONTAINER]	[CONTAINER]	[CONTAINER]
